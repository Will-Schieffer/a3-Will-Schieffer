Will Schieffer's Recipe Pinner (V2)

The goal of this application is to allow people to save recipes from various sites that they've made in the past, or would like to make in the future. 

I used OAuth, both because I wanted the achievement, but also because I had prior experience with it from my past projects, and knew there were a lot of resources out there to help me. Authentication is only availible through github at the moment, but that's sufficent for this assignment. 

I used Bootstrap as my CSS framework, mostly because I liked it aesthetic, and wanted to try using it for a front end assignment. In the past I've used Tailwind, so I kind of wanted to try something new. I found it to be a lot of fun! There is still CSS being used to style some of the components (mostly for accessibility score), but in general it's almost all Bootstrap.

I actually had the largest challenge in getting a perfect lighthouse score, so much so that I actually gave up on it. I managed to get a perfect score on the login page, but couldn't for the life of me get 100 on the performance on my index page. I tried setting up preloading (even making a new file for it to get around helmet's restrictions) but it actually lowered my score when I tried, so I just kind of left it, and pursued a +15 with middleware and OAuth.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy, specifically using passport.js.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: 5 express middleware packages were implemented and used
  - **express-session**: Manages logged-in user sessions by storing session data server-side and identifying returning requests via a cookie.
  - **passport**: Handles the authentication logic itself, plugging into Express as middleware to manage login state and integrate with the GitHub OAuth strategy.
  - **helmet**: Sets a batch of security-related HTTP response headers (like blocking the site from being framed by other domains) to guard against common web vulnerabilities.
  - **morgan**: Logs every incoming HTTP request to the console (method, path, status, response time). Hopefully this one counts since it's not functionally the user sees, but as a developer it was super nice to have.
  - **compression**: gzips HTTP responses before sending them, reducing payload size and speeding up page loads.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- No design achievements were successfully completed for this assignment.
